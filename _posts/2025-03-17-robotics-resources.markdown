This is intended to be a living document that contains links to some of the most valuable resources (videos, papers, books, courses) I've used to learn robotics theory beyond class.

## Math
(Slotine Lectures on Nonlinear Systems)[https://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/videos/lectures.html]
(Slotine Applied Nonlinear Control)[https://books.google.com/books/about/Applied_Nonlinear_Control.html?id=HddxQgAACAAJ]
(Underactuated Robotics Course Notes)[https://underactuated.mit.edu/index.html]
(ROB 501 @ Michigan)[https://github.com/michiganrobotics/rob501]
(Rob 530 @ Michigan)[https://github.com/UMich-CURLY-teaching/UMich-ROB-530-public]

## Robotics
(Thrun Probabilistic Robotics)[https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262201629/probabilistic-robotics/]
(Optimal Control Theory)[https://www.amazon.com/Optimal-Control-Theory-Introduction-Engineering/dp/0486434842]
